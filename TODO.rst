TODO
====
* Add implementation for get_memory() and get_battery()
* Implement showing output per flags
* Store the output of duplicate flags somewhere for faster execution?
* Add flag and implementation for device choosing (may be difficult with just 1 device to test on...)
* Move the Colors class to the global scope so that individual get_*()s can read from it if needed?
